:wave: Hello! I started as a simple enthusiast, I went ahead to an engineer, a full-stack software developer, a devops engineer, a project leader, a technical manager. Moreover I am 39% of a sysadmin, 13% of a creative, 20% of a designer, 7% of a tester and 41% of a PM.
I have excellent adaptability skills, I deal with everything with enthusiasm but I need to continuously feed my curiosity and my desire to discover new solutions. This is why I have been and I am so many things.

üíª By years I learned how to work with a dozen of programming languages, half a dozen of operating systems and an infinite number of approaches and technologies. I had to continuously vary and adapt my way of approaching and organizing job and time, learning how to manage code, infrastructures, projects, teams, departements and areas.

üëÄ I am a dreamer, a curious and, a little bit, a "geek". I always like to start with the simplest solution, but thinking to the best one.
I am a problem-solver, I am obstinate, I believe that nothing is impossible and that there is always a solution for everything.
I am extremely pragmatic, rational, analytical and, let's face it, rather cynical and disillusioned.
I'm interested in technology, photography and "on the road" traveling.
